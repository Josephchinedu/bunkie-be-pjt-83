# Backend repository for Team 83 Bunkie project

## Project Description
This project seeks to proffer a solution to one of the draining problems university students face: getting a decent accommodation and a compatible roommate to live with to split room costs. 

## Problem Statement
Most students face the problem of finding roommates with whom they can share a room and the cost. This is becoming so dire now that university hotels do not have enough dorms to accommodate students, and also most of these dorms are not even entirely conducive that people would prefer to stay off-campus, which could be expensive if you are alone and also proves difficult to look for a roommate with whom you can share the cost.
